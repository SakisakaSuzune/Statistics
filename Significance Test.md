## For Proportion
### Conditions
**Random**: The data come from a well-designed random sample or randomized experiment. 
**10%**: When sampling without replacement, check that $n ≤ \frac{1}{10}N$.
**Large Counts**: Both $np_{0}$ and $n(1-p_{0})$ are at least 10. 
$\hat{p} ～ N\left( p, \sqrt{ \frac{p(1-p)}{n} } \right)$

We failed to reject $H_{0}$. We do not have convincing evidence that $H_{a}$ is true. 

# Test Statistic
 $z = \dfrac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{ \frac{p_{0}(1-{p_{0}})}{n} }}$
 
 $t = \dfrac{\bar{x}-\mu_{0}}{s_{x}/\sqrt{ n }}$
 
# Interpretation for Power
If the true *parameter in context* is really *specified alternative value*, there is a *power* probability of finding convincing evidence that the *parameter in context* is different from/greater/less than *(hypothesized value in $H_{a}$)*.
