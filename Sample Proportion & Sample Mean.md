## Sample Proportion
$$
\hat{p} = \dfrac{X}{n}
$$
$$
E(\hat{p}) = E(\frac{X}{n}) = \frac{1}{n} E(X) = p
$$
$$
Var(\hat{p}) = \frac{{p(1-p)}}{n}
$$
$$
\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{ {\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} } ~ (10\%~rule)
$$

## Sample Mean

$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} (X_{1}+X_{2}+\dots+X_{n})
$$
$$
E(\bar{x}) = E(X)
$$
$$
\sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }} \ \ (10\%\ rule)
$$
$$
\bar{X}～N\left( \mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }} \right)
$$
## The Distribution of Mean of Non-Normal Sample
#### Central Limit Theorem
Draw an SRS of size n from any population with mean µ and finite standard deviation σ.
The central limit theorem (CLT) says that when n is large (n ≥ 30), the sampling distribution of the sample mean x-bar is approximately Normal.
