The basic principles for designing experiments are as follows:
## 1. Comparison. 
Use a design that compares **two or more treatments.**
**Placebo**: 安慰剂，没有实验效果的treatment
## 2. Random assignment. 
Use chance to assign experimental units to
treatments. Doing so helps create roughly equivalent groups of
experimental units by balancing the effects of other variables among
the treatment groups.
## 3. Control. 
**Keep other variables** that might affect the response **the same**
for all groups.
## 4. Replication. 
Use **enough experimental units in each group** so that any
<u>differences in the effects</u> of the treatments can be distinguished from
<u>chance differences</u> between the groups.
