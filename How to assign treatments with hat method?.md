1. Label each *(experimental unit in context)* of the *(population in context)* a distinct integer from 1 to *N* and write them on identical slips of paper. 
2. Put the slips in a **hat** and mix them all. 
3. Pull out *n* slips and assign *treatment 1* to the (experimental units in context) that correspond to the chosen numbers. 
4. Pull out **another** *n* slips and assign *treatment 2* to the (experimental units in context) that correspond to the chosen numbers. 
5. ............
6. Assign treatment *n* to the remaining experimental units. 

-------------------
1. Label each experimental unit of the population a distinct integer from 1 to *N*.
2. Use a random number generator to obtain *n* distinct integers and assign *treatment 1* to the experimental units that correspond to the obtained numbers. 
3. Use the random number generator to obtain *n* distinct integers and assign *treatment 2* to the experimental units that correspond to the obtained numbers. 
4. ............
5. Assign treatment *n* to the remaining experimental units. 

--------------------
Pull out <font color="#92d050">the first, second, ...... and treatment count</font> *n* slips, without replacement, and assign treatment <font color="#92d050">1, 2, ...... and treatment count</font> to the students that correspond to the chosen numbers, respectively.
