1. Label each (individual in context) of the (population in context) a distinct integer from 1 to *N* and write them on identical slips of paper. 
2. Put the slips in a **hat** and mix them all. 
3. Pull out *n* slips and select the (individuals in context) that correspond to the chosen numbers as an SRS. 
------------------
1. Label each individual of the population a distinct integer from 1 to *N*.
2. Use a random number generator to obtain *n* distinct integers from 1 to *N*.
3. Select individuals that correspond to the obtained numbers as an SRS. 

-------------------
However, an SRS is not representative enough, see [[Stratified Random Sample & Cluster Sample|Stratified Random Sample]] for a better choice.
