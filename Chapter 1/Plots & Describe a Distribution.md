## Dot Plot
![[Pasted image 20260128201647.png]]
1. 不用从0开始。
2. 把所有点都点上，每个点都要表示出来。

Key: $8|2 ⇒ 82$.

## Histogram
![[Pasted image 20260128204843.png]]
Each column should be placed right next to the other.
Only for quantitative variables.

## Box Plot
![[Pasted image 20260128205331.png]]
The most common way to visually describe a distribution.
Median, Q1 and Q3 refers to 

## Describe a Distribution
1. Shape
	1. ??modal: Unimodal, Bimodal, Multimodal
	2. Symmetry: Symmetric, Roughly Symmetric, Left Skewed, Right Skewed.

2. Center
	1. Mean, which is not resistant and easily affected by outliers. **Suggested only for roughly symmetric distributions.**
	2. Median($Q_{2}$) ★ , outlier-resistant. (3 is the median in {1, 2, 3, 4, 1000}, while 202 is the mean.)
	3. Mode,  the value that appears most frequently in a data set, is resistant but cannot represent the center.

3. Spread
	1. [[Standard Deviation]].
	2. Range ($\text{min}-\text{max}$), not resistant.
	3. IQR ($Q_{3}-Q_{1}$), resistant.

4. Outlier ([[1.5 IQR Rule]]), which is represented as $*$ in the box plot.
