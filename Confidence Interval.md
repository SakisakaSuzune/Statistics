# Sample Proportion
$$
\hat{p}±z^*\sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}(1-p)}{n} }
$$

### A Four-Step Process
1. State: We want a C% confidence interval for ...
2. Plan: We should use a one-sample Z interval.
	1. Random: The data come from a random sample.
	2. 10%: There are at least 10n ...
	3. Large Counts: np
3. Do: Confidence Interval = ... = ... ± ... × ... = (..., ...)
4. Conclude: We are C% confident that the interval (..., ...) captures the true value. 

# Sample Mean
### t-distribution

$$
t = \frac{{\bar{x} - \mu}}{s_{x}/\sqrt{ n }}
$$
$$
\bar{x} = t^* \frac{s_{x}}{ \sqrt{ n }}
$$
### Three Conditions
1. Random
2. 10% rule
3. Normal / Large Sample
	1. If the distribution is Normal:
		1. The sample mean distribution is approximately Normal.
	2. If the distribution is not Normal: 
		1. If the sample size is greater than 30: 
			1. The sample mean distribution is approximately Normal (CLT).
		2. If the sample size is less than 30: 
			1. According to the box plot, there is no strong skewness or outlier. We should use t-distribution with cautions.
