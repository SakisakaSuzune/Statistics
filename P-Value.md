## Interpretation
Assuming that the *(parameter in context)* is *(hypothesized value in $H_{0}$)*, there is *(P-value)* probability of getting a sample *(statistic)* of at least/most *(observed value of statistics)* just by chance in a random sample of *(sample size) (individuals in context)*. 

## Reject $H_{0}$
Because P-value > ɑ, we reject $H_{0}$. We have convincing evidence that the *(parameter in context)* is <u>different from/greater than/less</u> than the *(hypothesized value in $H_{0}$)*. 

## Failed to Reject $H_{0}$
Because P-value < ɑ, we failed to reject $H_{0}$. We do **not** have convincing evidence that the *(parameter in context)* is <u>different from/greater than/less than</u> the *(hypothesized value in $H_{0}$)*.
